# OVH Deploy Hosting Action

A GitHub Action to deploy the contents of a repository to an OVH Hosting Plan (with SSH support)

> This GitHub Action works best with the OVH Pro Hosting plan. It might work with other providers if their hosting product meet the reguirements listed below.

## Requirements

- OVH Account with an active [Pro Hosting](https://www.ovh.de/hosting/hosting-pro.xml) service (which has SSH-support)

  - A new user with SSH access to your hosting account (Web -> Hosting plans -> `<yourPlan>` -> FTP - SSH -> Create a FTP user)

  - Grant the user SSH access after you created the account

  - Ensure you configured the users home directory as the websites root directory

- A repository with your websites code

- Needed environment variables are configured and the SSH users name + password are available as GitHub secrets (`<yourRepository>` -> Settings -> Secrets -> New secret)

## Example usage

Inside your code base/repository create the directories `.github/workflows`. In the `workflows` folder create a file `main.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy my nice code
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to OVH hosting
        uses: pitscher/ovh-deploy-hosting-action@v1
        env:
          OVH_HOSTING_USER: ${{ secrets.OVH_HOSTING_USER }}
          OVH_HOSTING_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.OVH_HOSTING_PASSWORD }}
          OVH_HOSTING_DOMAIN: ssh.clusterXXX.hosting.ovh.net
          REPOSITORY_NAME: my-repo
          REPOSITORY_URL: https://github.com/me/my-repo.git
          DESTINATION_PATH: .
```

Now simply adjust the last three listed environment variables. Visit your OVH hosting plans control panel to get the correct SSH domain.
Don't forget to create two secrets at your repository with the names `OVH_HOSTING_USER` + `OVH_HOSTING_PASSWORD` and the appropriate credentials as the value. Use a strong password!

With this GitHub Actions configuration everytime you push new changes to your repository, the ovh-deploy-hosting-action will login to your hosting account, delete all existing files at the users home directory and get the newest version of your repo/code. Additionally the action will ensure to copy the needed `.htaccess` (so keep them in your repo) and delete unnecessary files like `LICENSE` & `README.md`.

You can use the following `.htaccess` to ensure all traffic is redirected from http:// to https:// and disallow the web servers index listing. Make sure to replace `my-domain.com` resp. `.com` with your own domain.
Keep in mind that the `.htaccess` will only take effect if your hosting plan relies at Apache web servers (which is the case if you use OVH).

```htaccess
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^my-domain\.com$ [NC,OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} =off
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://my-domain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
</IfModule>
Options -Indexes
```
